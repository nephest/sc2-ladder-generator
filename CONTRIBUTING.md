# How to contribute
## Places for contribution
Github issues is the place for any kind of contribution:
* Feature request
* Bug report
* Question

You are welcome to contribute in any way you like.

## Developing lifecycle
Every major version has its own github project where all relevant issues are residing.
After the project start, new feature requests will be moved to the next project.
Bug reports are going into the currently active project.

## Contribution Requirements
No level of competence required, I am learning how to create some web apps here, so can you.
Here is a list of basic rules you must follow:
* Like/play StarCraft2. You must understand what info a SC2 player would like to see. 
* Your code must pass all the tests, including integration tests
* Squash/fixup relevant commits before creating a PR
* Only the master branch matters, all other branches are private working branches and could be force pushed any time

## Code style
* Newline braces
* 4 spaces indentation
